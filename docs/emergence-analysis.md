## 1. Nested Feedback Loops — Homeostatic Regulation

**The Core Mechanism:**
Three independent feedback loops operate at different timescales simultaneously:

- **Micro** (per-node): Exponential backoff retry — 0.5s → 1s → 2s → 4s, capped at 30s
- **Meso** (per-stage): Context accumulation — each node's output enriches the prompt for the next, giving the LLM progressive memory
- **Macro** (per-pipeline): Goal gates at the exit node — if any quality gate fails, the engine clears completed nodes and loops back to a retry target, re-executing entire pipeline sections

**The Emergent Property:**
These loops don't just handle failure — they create **iterative refinement**. A pipeline can produce progressively better output across multiple passes without any single component knowing about "quality improvement." The retry system handles transient failures, context accumulation builds knowledge, and goal gates enforce standards. Together they produce convergent behavior toward a quality threshold that no individual loop implements.

**Biological Parallel:**
**Mammalian thermoregulation.** Shivering (fast/local), metabolic rate adjustment (medium/systemic), and behavioral adaptation (slow/whole-organism) operate at different timescales to maintain 37°C. No single mechanism "knows" the target temperature — homeostasis emerges from layered feedback.

**Optimization Tip:**
Add a `convergence_score` to the context that goal gates can compare across iterations. If the score plateaus (delta < threshold for N iterations), trigger a different retry target or escalate to a human-in-the-loop node rather than repeating the same path. This mimics allostasis — adjusting the setpoint when the current strategy stops improving.

## 2. Multi-Signal Edge Selection — Stigmergic Routing

**The Core Mechanism:**
Edge selection integrates five independent signals in a priority cascade:

1. Condition expressions evaluated against context (`outcome=success && stage.result!=empty`)
2. Preferred label from the handler's outcome (LLM chooses its path)
3. Suggested next IDs from the handler
4. Edge weight (numeric priority)
5. Lexical ordering (deterministic tiebreak)

No single signal controls routing. The LLM can influence its own future path via preferred labels, prior nodes influence routing via context conditions, and the graph author sets defaults via weights.

**The Emergent Property:**
**Adaptive routing without a central router.** The path through the pipeline is not predetermined — it's an emergent consensus between the graph structure, the LLM's decisions, and the accumulated state. A pipeline can discover execution paths that the author never explicitly designed, because condition+label combinations create a combinatorial space larger than any single edge definition.

**Biological Parallel:**
**Ant colony pheromone trails.** Ants don't have a map — each ant follows local chemical gradients laid by others. The "best" path emerges from accumulated signals. Similarly, each node deposits context (pheromones), and edge selection follows the strongest signal cascade. The `weight` attribute acts like pheromone decay — a persistent baseline bias that conditions can override.

**Optimization Tip:**
Track which edges are actually taken across pipeline runs and surface "dead edges" (conditions that never fire) and "hot paths" (edges always taken). This would create a meta-feedback loop where the graph structure itself adapts to observed behavior — artificial pheromone reinforcement.

## 3. Context Diffusion — Distributed Memory Formation

**The Core Mechanism:**
The `Context` is a shared `HashMap<String, Value>` behind an `Arc<RwLock>`. After each node executes:

```
context.apply_updates(outcome.context_updates)
```

The `CodergenHandler` then injects prior results into the next node's prompt:

```
"Context from prior pipeline steps:
 - node1.result: <output>
 - node2.result: <output>"
```

Each node sees all prior results but doesn't know which nodes produced them or why.

**The Emergent Property:**
**Collective intelligence.** No single node has the full picture, but the pipeline as a whole accumulates knowledge that makes later nodes more effective. Early nodes doing research improve later nodes doing implementation — not because they were designed to cooperate, but because context accumulation creates implicit knowledge transfer. The pipeline's output quality is greater than the sum of individual node outputs.

**Biological Parallel:**
**Neural long-term potentiation.** When neurons fire together repeatedly, their synaptic connections strengthen. In PAS, when a node produces useful context that improves downstream outcomes, the "connection" (context key) persists and strengthens the pipeline's overall performance. The context is the pipeline's working memory — it doesn't forget what it learned.

**Optimization Tip:**
Implement context pruning with relevance scoring. As context grows, later nodes get increasingly long prompts. A `context_relevance` transform could score which prior results are actually useful for each node (based on shared keywords or explicit `depends_on` declarations) and drop low-relevance entries. This mimics synaptic pruning — forgetting irrelevant memories to maintain signal-to-noise ratio.

## 4. Cost-Aware Self-Limitation — Metabolic Budgeting

**The Core Mechanism:**
Each `CodergenHandler` execution reports `total_cost_usd`. The engine sums these into `total_cost` and checks against `max_budget_usd` ($200 default) before every node execution. Exceeding the budget produces a `BudgetExceeded` error with clean termination.

This interacts with the retry system: retries consume additional budget. A node that retries 3 times costs 4x its base cost, eating into the global budget faster.

**The Emergent Property:**
**Resource-aware execution.** The pipeline naturally spends more budget on harder problems (more retries, more complex prompts) and less on easy ones — without any explicit resource allocation logic. The budget constraint creates implicit prioritization: if early nodes are expensive, later nodes get fewer retry opportunities. The pipeline self-allocates its budget based on actual difficulty encountered.

**Biological Parallel:**
**Metabolic rate regulation in hibernating animals.** Bears don't consciously allocate calories — their body automatically reduces metabolism as fat reserves deplete. Similarly, the pipeline doesn't "decide" to spend less on later nodes — the shrinking remaining budget naturally constrains retry attempts, creating energy conservation under scarcity.

**Optimization Tip:**
Expose per-node budget hints (`max_node_budget_usd`) so critical nodes can reserve budget capacity. Add a `budget_remaining` context key so downstream nodes can adjust their own behavior (e.g., use cheaper models when budget is low). This creates metabolic awareness — organs (nodes) adapting to the organism's (pipeline's) energy state.

## 5. Shape-Driven Polymorphism — Morphological Computation

**The Core Mechanism:**
A node's visual shape in the DOT graph directly determines its execution behavior:

| Shape         | Handler     | Behavior                   |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Mdiamond      | start       | Entry point                |
| box           | codergen    | LLM execution              |
| diamond       | conditional | Routing decision           |
| parallelogram | tool        | Shell command              |
| hexagon       | wait.human  | Human-in-the-loop          |
| component     | parallel    | Fan-out                    |
| Msquare       | exit        | Terminal + goal gate check |

The same graph is both the visual documentation and the executable specification.

**The Emergent Property:**
**Self-documenting execution.** The pipeline's behavior can be understood by looking at its shape — literally. This eliminates the gap between architecture diagrams and runtime behavior. When someone modifies the graph's visual structure, they simultaneously modify its execution semantics. The "documentation" can never drift from the "implementation."

**Biological Parallel:**
**Morphological computation in soft robotics.** An octopus arm's physical structure (shape, flexibility) computes grasping behavior without neural control — the shape IS the program. Similarly, a DOT node's shape IS its handler type. Change the shape, change the behavior. The structure computes.

**Optimization Tip:**
Add composite shapes that combine behaviors — e.g., a shape that means "LLM execution with mandatory human review" (codergen + wait.human in sequence). This creates morphological composability, where complex behaviors emerge from shape combinations rather than explicit handler coding.

## 6. Checkpoint-Based Crash Recovery — Cellular Regeneration

**The Core Mechanism:**
After each node completes, the engine saves a `PipelineCheckpoint` containing:

- Current node ID
- All completed nodes
- All node outcomes
- Full context snapshot
- Timestamp and session ID

On restart, `load_checkpoint()` discovers the latest state and resumes from the last incomplete node, skipping already-completed work.

**The Emergent Property:**
**Stateless resilience.** The engine process itself can crash, restart, even run on a different machine — and the pipeline continues exactly where it left off. Combined with goal gates, this means a pipeline can survive multiple crashes and still converge on its goal. The system's "memory" lives in the checkpoint, not in any process's RAM.

**Biological Parallel:**
**Planarian regeneration.** Cut a planarian worm into pieces and each piece regrows into a complete organism. The "body plan" is encoded in every cell, not in a central brain. Similarly, the checkpoint encodes the full pipeline state — any engine instance can pick it up and continue the organism's life.

**Optimization Tip:**
Add checkpoint diffing — instead of saving full snapshots, save deltas from the previous checkpoint. This reduces I/O and enables efficient "time travel" debugging (replay the pipeline state at any past node). This mimics epigenetic memory — recording what changed, not the full state.

## 7. Latent Property: Validation + Transforms as an Immune System

**The Core Mechanism:**
Before execution begins, two systems run in sequence:

1. **Validation** (12 lint rules) checks structural integrity — missing start nodes, unreachable nodes, invalid conditions, dangling edges
2. **Transforms** normalize the graph — applying stylesheet defaults, expanding prompt variables

These run before any handler executes. Invalid graphs never reach the engine.

**The Emergent Property:**
**Structural immunity.** The validation system doesn't just catch errors — it prevents entire categories of runtime failure from ever occurring. An unreachable node can never cause a "stuck pipeline" because it's caught before execution. This creates a **latent safety net**: the interaction between validation rules catches failure modes that no individual rule was designed for. For example, `reachability` + `edge_target_exists` + `start_no_incoming` together guarantee that every node can be reached and every edge leads somewhere valid — a property stronger than any individual check.

**Biological Parallel:**
**Innate immune system.** Pattern-recognition receptors (like toll-like receptors) don't target specific pathogens — they recognize broad categories of "non-self" structural patterns. The validation rules similarly recognize broad categories of "non-valid" graph patterns. New, never-seen-before graph errors are still caught if they violate structural invariants.

**Optimization Tip:**
Add runtime validation that re-checks invariants mid-execution (e.g., verify that the context hasn't grown beyond a size limit, or that cost tracking is consistent). This creates an adaptive immune response — catching threats that bypass the innate system. Log validation warnings as events so the telemetry system can surface structural degradation over time.

The deepest emergence in this system is that **the pipeline is not a program — it's an environment**. The DOT graph defines a landscape, context provides nutrients, handlers are organisms, and constraints (budget, steps, goal gates) are selection pressures. What "runs" is not a predetermined sequence but an adaptive traversal that responds to its own outputs. The pipeline doesn't execute a plan — it evolves toward a goal.
