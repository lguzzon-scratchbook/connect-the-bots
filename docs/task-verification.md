# Task Verification in PAS

How PAS verifies that pipeline nodes (agent tasks) actually completed — and completed correctly. Verification is layered, moving from basic execution checks to deep logic validation.

---

## 1. Execution Handshake (Handler Dispatch)

The first layer is **transport-level**. When the pipeline engine dispatches a task to a handler, it expects a well-formed `Outcome` response.

- **Handler Resolution:** The engine resolves the handler type for each node (`codergen`, `start`, `exit`, `conditional`) and looks it up in the `HandlerRegistry`. If no handler is registered, execution fails immediately with a `HandlerError`.
- **Timeout / Budget Guards:** The engine enforces `max_steps` and `max_budget_usd` limits. If a node hangs or the pipeline enters a runaway loop, it aborts with a clear error rather than running forever.
- **Failure on No Response:** If a handler returns `StageStatus::Fail` and there is no outgoing edge to handle the failure, the pipeline terminates with a `HandlerError`.

**Relevant code:** `crates/attractor-pipeline/src/engine.rs` — the main execution loop (Phase 4).

---

## 2. Output Schema (Outcome Structure)

Every handler must return an `Outcome` struct. The type system enforces the contract at compile time:

| Field                | Type                     | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`             | `StageStatus`            | `Success`, `Fail`, `PartialSuccess`, `Retry`, `Skipped` |
| `preferred_label`    | `Option<String>`         | Hint for edge selection (conditional routing)           |
| `suggested_next_ids` | `Vec<String>`            | Ordered preference for next node                        |
| `context_updates`    | `HashMap<String, Value>` | Key-value pairs merged into pipeline context            |
| `notes`              | `String`                 | Human-readable summary of what happened                 |
| `failure_reason`     | `Option<String>`         | Explanation when status is `Fail`                       |

- **Structure enforcement:** Rust's type system guarantees every handler returns all required fields. There is no "malformed result" at runtime — the compiler catches it.
- **Data integrity:** Context updates use `serde_json::Value`, so type mismatches (e.g., string where a number is expected) surface when downstream nodes consume them via typed accessors.
- **Status propagation:** The engine writes `outcome` to the pipeline context after each node, making the result available to edge conditions.

**Relevant code:** `crates/attractor-types/src/lib.rs` — `Outcome` and `StageStatus` definitions.

## 3. Functional Logic Verification (Goal Gates)

This is the "proof of work" layer. The pipeline doesn't just trust that a node succeeded — goal gates enforce that **the intended change actually happened**.

### How it works

1. Mark critical nodes with `goal_gate=true` in the DOT definition.
2. When the pipeline reaches the exit node (`shape="Msquare"`), the engine checks **all** goal gate nodes.
3. If any goal gate node's outcome is not `Success`, the pipeline either retries or fails.

### Retry resolution order

When a goal gate fails, the engine looks for a retry target in this order:

1. **Node `retry_target`** — the failing node's own attribute
2. **Node `fallback_retry_target`** — the node's fallback
3. **Graph `retry_target`** — graph-level default
4. **Graph `fallback_retry_target`** — graph-level fallback
5. **No target found** → `GoalGateUnsatisfied` error (pipeline aborts)

### Example

```dot
digraph CodeReview {
    start [shape="Mdiamond"]
    implement [shape="box", prompt="Write the feature code"]
    test [shape="box", prompt="Run the test suite",
          goal_gate=true, retry_target="implement"]
    done [shape="Msquare"]

    start -> implement -> test -> done
}
```

If `test` fails, the pipeline loops back to `implement`. On the next pass, `implement` gets the failure context and can fix the code. The cycle continues until tests pass or `max_retries` / `max_steps` is hit.

**Relevant code:** `crates/attractor-pipeline/src/goal_gate.rs` — `enforce_goal_gates()`.

---

## 4. Conditional Edge Routing (Multi-Path Validation)

Instead of binary pass/fail, PAS supports **condition-based routing** that lets the pipeline take different verification paths based on node outcomes or context values.

### Edge conditions

```dot
check -> fix_path   [condition="outcome=fail"]
check -> next_step  [condition="outcome=success"]
check -> review     [condition="outcome=partial_success"]
```

Conditions can reference:

- `outcome` — the node's execution status
- `preferred_label` — the node's suggested edge label
- Any key in the pipeline context (e.g., `deploy_env=prod`)

### Edge selection algorithm

1. Check edges with matching conditions first
2. Fall back to `preferred_label` match
3. Fall back to `suggested_next_ids` from the handler
4. Fall back to `default=true` edge
5. Fall back to the single unconditional edge (if only one exists)

This enables verification patterns like "if tests pass, deploy; if tests partially pass, run extended tests; if tests fail, loop back to fix."

**Relevant code:** `crates/attractor-pipeline/src/edge_selection.rs` — `select_edge()`.

---

## 5. State Observation (Context & Checkpoint)

The pipeline maintains a shared `Context` (an async key-value store) that serves as the state observer.

### Status progression

As each node executes, the context tracks the full pipeline state:

- **Before execution:** Node is the `current_node` in the engine loop
- **After execution:** `Outcome` recorded in `node_outcomes` map, context updates applied
- **At exit:** `enforce_goal_gates()` audits all gate nodes before allowing completion

### Checkpoint/resume

Pipeline state can be serialized mid-execution and restored later, enabling:

- Long-running pipelines that survive process restarts
- Human review gates that pause for approval
- Debugging failed pipelines from the point of failure

### Cost tracking

Each node's `cost_usd` context update is accumulated. The engine logs per-node and running totals, and aborts if the budget is exceeded.

**Relevant code:** `crates/attractor-types/src/lib.rs` — `Context` implementation.

## 6. Static Validation (Lint Rules)

Before any execution begins, the pipeline is validated against 12 built-in lint rules:

| Rule                     | Severity | What it checks                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Start/exit node presence | Error    | Pipeline has exactly one start and at least one exit |
| Reachability             | Error    | All nodes are reachable from start                   |
| Edge targets exist       | Error    | No edges pointing to undefined nodes                 |
| Condition syntax         | Error    | Edge conditions are well-formed                      |
| Goal gate has retry      | Warning  | Goal gate nodes have a retry target defined          |
| Prompt presence          | Warning  | Execution nodes have a prompt attribute              |
| Fidelity values          | Warning  | Context fidelity attributes use valid prefixes       |
| Orphan detection         | Warning  | No disconnected subgraphs                            |

Validation runs as Phase 2 of the 5-phase lifecycle (parse → **validate** → initialize → execute → finalize). Errors abort before any LLM calls are made.

**Relevant code:** `crates/attractor-pipeline/src/validation.rs` — `validate()` and `validate_or_raise()`.
