# PAS — Pascal's Discrete Attractor

A DOT-based pipeline runner for AI workflows. Define multi-step agent pipelines as Graphviz digraphs, then run them with built-in tool use, multi-provider LLM support, and checkpoint/resume.

These loops don't just handle failure — they create iterative refinement. A pipeline can produce progressively better output across multiple passes without any single component knowing about "quality improvement." The retry system handles transient failures, context accumulation builds knowledge, and goal gates enforce standards. Together they produce convergent behavior toward a quality threshold that no individual loop implements.

### How verification works

PAS doesn't just run tasks — it verifies them. Six layers of checks ensure that every pipeline node actually did what it was supposed to do, from static analysis before any LLM call to runtime proof-of-work at the exit gate.

</p>

1. **Static Validation** — 12 lint rules check pipeline structure before any LLM call. Missing start nodes, unreachable steps, and malformed conditions are caught immediately.
2. **Handler Dispatch** — The engine resolves each node's handler type (codergen, conditional, tool, etc.) and aborts if the handler isn't registered.
3. **Outcome Schema** — Rust's type system enforces the response contract at compile time. Every handler must return a status, context updates, and notes — malformed results are structurally impossible.
4. **Edge Routing** — A 5-step cascade selects the next edge: condition match → preferred label → suggested ID → weight → lexical tiebreak. This enables patterns like "pass → deploy, partial → extended tests, fail → fixup loop."
5. **Goal Gates** — The "proof of work" layer. Nodes marked `goal_gate=true` are audited at exit. If any gate is unsatisfied, the engine resolves a retry target (node → fallback → graph-level) and loops back. No target found means pipeline abort.
6. **Budget & Step Guards** — `max_steps`, `max_budget_usd`, and `max_retries` are enforced continuously. Runaway loops are impossible.

## Overview

PAS lets you describe AI workflows as directed graphs using DOT syntax. Each node is a step (LLM call, tool use, human gate, parallel fan-out) and edges define the flow with optional conditions. The engine handles execution, edge selection, retries, goal enforcement, and cost tracking.

```dot
digraph CodeReview {
    start [shape=Mdiamond]
    analyze [label="Analyze Code", model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
    test [label="Run Tests", type="tool"]
    review [label="Review Results"]
    done [shape=Msquare]

    start -> analyze -> test -> review -> done
}
```

## Claude Code Integration

PAS's default `codergen` handler executes pipeline nodes by shelling out to your local [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installation (`claude` CLI). This means each node in your pipeline gets the full agentic capabilities of Claude Code — file editing, bash execution, multi-turn tool use — powered by your existing Claude subscription with no separate API keys required.

Under the hood, each `codergen` node runs:

```
claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format json
```

The handler parses Claude Code's JSON response to extract the result, cost, turn count, and success/failure status, then feeds that context forward to downstream nodes.

### Node attributes for Claude Code nodes

| Attribute           | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt` (required) | The task prompt sent to Claude Code                   |
| `llm_model`         | Model override (e.g. `"sonnet"`, `"haiku"`, `"opus"`) |
| `allowed_tools`     | Comma-separated list of tools Claude Code may use     |
| `max_budget_usd`    | Spending cap for this node                            |

Conditional nodes (`shape=diamond`) automatically instruct Claude Code to select an outgoing edge label, enabling LLM-driven branching.

For nodes that only need a single LLM completion without tool use, PAS also provides direct API handlers for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini via the `attractor-llm` crate.

- **Cost tracking** -- Per-node and total USD cost reporting

## Installation

```sh
./install.sh
```

This builds a release binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin/pas`.

Or install via cargo:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/attractor-cli
```

### Build Profiles

Four build profiles provide speed/optimization tradeoffs:

| Profile         | Use Case          | LTO  | Time  | Binary Size |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| `dev` (default) | Development       | Off  | ~3s   | Large       |
| `quick-release` | Fast CI/iterating | Off  | ~8s   | Medium      |
| `release`       | Daily use         | Thin | ~45s  | Small       |
| `dist`          | Distribution      | Fat  | ~5min | Smallest    |

Use with `cargo build --profile <name>` or `PAS_PROFILE=<name> ./install.sh`.

For 90% optimization at CI speed: `./install.sh --fast` (uses `quick-release`).

Enable additional speedups with `sccache`:

```sh
./scripts/setup-fast-builds.sh  # One-time setup
export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache    # Add to shell profile
```

## Usage

### Run a pipeline

```sh
pas run pipeline.dot --workdir ./my-project
```

### Validate a pipeline

```sh
pas validate pipeline.dot
```

### Inspect a pipeline

```sh
pas info pipeline.dot
```

### Dry run (no LLM calls)

```sh
pas run pipeline.dot --dry-run
```

### Generate a pipeline from a spec (no beads)

```sh
# Spec only
pas generate spec.md

# PRD + spec (positional)
pas generate prd.md spec.md

# PRD + spec (named flags)
pas generate --prd prd.md --spec spec.md

# Custom output path
pas generate spec.md -o pipelines/my-feature.dot
```

### Planning workflow (PRD → Spec → Beads → Pipeline)

```sh
# Generate a PRD from a prompt
pas plan --prd --from-prompt "Add user authentication with OAuth2"

# Or copy the blank template and edit manually
pas plan --spec

# Decompose a spec into beads epic + tasks
pas decompose .pas/spec.md

# Scaffold a pipeline from the beads epic
pas scaffold <EPIC_ID>

# Run the generated pipeline
pas run pipelines/<EPIC_ID>.dot -w .
```

There's also a meta-pipeline that chains the full workflow end-to-end:

```sh
pas run templates/plan-to-execute.dot -w .
```
